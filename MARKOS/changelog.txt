- Removed constraint
Feature subclassOf NamedEntity (redundant)


V1.0
====
version date: 2013/07/16

Changed class definition
- Package (now the elements must have to the same provenance, but must be contained in a same release)

Renamed classes
- TypedEntity -> Variable 
- top#Classifier -> (software#) Classifier (also changed the definition to align it to UML2)

Added classes
- BehaviorParameter (A Parameter of a Behavior, it is both a Parameter and a LocalVariable)

Removed classes
- reification#Entity (unused)
- reification#Statement (unused)
- DependsOn (unused)
- reification#InformationSource (unused)
- top#InformationSource (unused)
- NestedClass (redundant)
- NestedInterface (redundant)

Renamed properties
- (software#)name -> top#name (also NamedEntity and namespace are in top)
- TypedEntity -> Variable (to make explicit the meaning) 
- top#Classifier -> (software#)Classifier (also changed the definition to align it to UML2)
- referredEntity -> referredVariable (to make the name more related to actual meaning)
- implementedOperation -> directImplementedOperation (do make evident that it is not transitive)
- importedLibrary -> linkedLibrary (to make more explicit the intended semantics)
- type -> valueType (to make more evident that is a property defined on Variables)
- ownedVariable -> ownedLocalVariable (to make explicit that it is not a generalisation of ownedAttribute and ownedParameter)
- licenses#argumentation -> licenses#analyses

Removed properties
- reification#subject (unused)
- reification#object (unused)
- reification#predicate (unused)
- reification#informationSource (unused)
- redefinedOperation (substituted by redefinedEntity)
- top#redefinedClassifier (substituted by redefinedEntity)
- staticallyUsedSoftwareEntity (redundant, we are going to analyse only static usages, and in any case this should be an attribute as most kind of dependencies may be both static or dynamic)
- dinamicallyUsedSoftwareEntity (we are not going to analyse dynamic usages, and in any case this should be an attribute as most kind of dependencies may be both static or dynamic)

Added properties
- redefinedEntity: SoftwareEntity x SoftwareEntity (an entity, e.g. a feature of a Classifier, redefined in a specialised Classifier)
- directImplementedInterface: Classifier x Interface (interface directly implemented by the subject entity)
- directSuperType: Classifier x Classifier (e.g. a direct superclass or a directly implemented interface) 
- directExtendedType: Classifier x Classifier (e.g. a direct superclass)

Removed Constraints
- ParameterDirectionKind sublcassOf SoftwareEntity (wrong as ParameterDirectionKind is just a meta-data)
- license#CopyrightLicense subclassOf VisibilityKind (wrong) 
- DataType subclassOf Type (redundant because it is subclassOf Classifier)
- ProgrammingLanguage subclassOf SoftwareWork (added constraint on ProgrammingLanguageVersion)
- AnnotationType -> DataType (not true in Java and C#)
- Component subclasOf Classifier (redundant)
- Domain of ownedParameter: Behavior (now it is only Operation; instead the Behavior owns BehaviorParameters as value of ownedLocalVariable) 

Added Constraints
- ParameterDirectionKind sublcassOf top#Entity
- license#CopyrightLicense subclassOf top#Entity
- ExceptionType subclassOf Classifier
- ProgrammingLanguageVersion subclassOf SoftwareWork
- ProgrammingLanguage subclassOf top#NamedEntity

Added Individuals: 
privateVisibility, publicVisibility, packageVisibility, protectedVisibility (to represent the visibility of operation)
 
Added annotation properties:
 - top#correspondingSuperProperty (used to map properties of different ontologies when rdfs:subPropertyOf cannot be used due to different representation of property values) 
 - top#correspondingProperty (used to map properties of different ontologies when owl:equivalentProperty cannot be used due to different representation of property values) 
 - top#identityCriteria (list the key properties used to identify the instances of a specific class)
 - top#canonicalURICriteria (describes how the canonical RDF URI for an instance of the subject class should be composed)
 - markos#provenanceManifestationCriteria (clarifies in a more precise way the semantics of the provenance for a specific type of Work) 
 - top#nameCriteria (clarify which is the name of a specific type of NamedEntity).
 - top#namespaceCriteria (clarify which is the namespace of a specific type of NamedEntity).
 - top#versionCriteria (clarify which is the version of a specific type of VersionedEntity).

Added annotations:
 - identityCriteria, canonicalURICriteria, provenanceManifestationCriteria, nameCriteria namespaceCriteria and versionCriteria on classes SoftwareEntity, File, SoftwareClass, Operation, Library, API, Package

Removed properties:
 - tag (substituted with markos:topic)
 - feature (added for error)

Removed constraints:
 - forkSoftwareEntity subpropertyOf usedSoftwareWork (wrong)
 - successiveVersion subpropertyOf usedSoftwareWork (wrong)
 - Directory subclassOf FileSystemElement (redundant)
 - SoftwareProject subclassOf Entity (redundant)
 - SoftwareRelease subclassOf Container (not all SoftwareReleases are Containers)
 - SoftwareRelease.manifestation allValuesFrom FileContainer (not all SoftwareReleases have a FileContainer as manifestation)
 - containerEntity is functional (wrong, an entity may belong to two different containers, e.g. a same class may belong to two different SoftwareReleases)
 - superordinateEntity is functional (wrong, an entity may belong to two different containers and therefore may have more superodinates)
 - SoftwareArtifact subclassOf SoftwareArtifact (wrong)
 - API subclassOf Package (with the new definition an API is a portion of a Package or Library) 

Changed textual definitions of:
 - manifestation (generalized to any work, not just software entities)
 - provenance (clarified the difference between using project and provenance project)
 - provenanceManifestation (generalized to any Work)
 - FileSystemElement (estended: also a set of file elements may be itself a file element)
 - Operation (corrected typos)
 - SoftwareObjectType (corrected typos)
 - SoftwareRelease (now a software release is one SoftwareWork instead of a set of SoftwareWork)
 - Container (clarified the specificity of a container with respect to an entity having parts)
 - Improved the definition of releasedSoftware and SoftwareRelease.

Renamed (tried to use more intuitive names):
 - producingCompiler -> usedCompiler
 - software#containerEntity -> top#containerEntity
 - webInterface -> webInterfaceURL
 - webSite -> webSiteURL
 - licenses#instantiatedTemplate -> licenses#template
 - implementingLanguage -> implementationLanguage
 - declaredImplementingLanguage -> declaredImplementationLanguage
 - softwareImplementingLanguage -> softwareImplementationLanguage
 
Other changes
 - Removed ObjectProperty ownedSoftwareEntity (useless)
 - Removed cardinality constraint on provenanceManifestation of Library (wrong)
 - Removed Class Property (useless)
 - rdfs:comment of FileContainer (clarified it is a FileSystemElement)
 - providedInterface: Component x Interface (previous range, SoftwareEntity, was wrong)
 - software#previousVersion: SoftwareWork x softwareWork (needed to be a subproperty of usedSoftwareWork)
 - software#successiveVersion: SoftwareWork x softwareWork (to be inverseOf proviousVersion) 
 - moved labels of licenses concepts to the licenses ontology (they were in the software ontology)
 - changed rdfs:label of OwnedMember to rdfs:comment 
 - provenance: SoftwareWork x SoftwareProject (extended the domain from SoftwareEntity to SoftwareWork to apply it also to a File)
 - rdfs:seeAlso of File to rdfs:comment (it was rdfs:seeAlso for error)
 - Definition of class API (the old one was too restrictive for practical usage)
 - Definition of class Package (the meaning is the same of the old one, but the description is more detailed).
 - Class top#Feature now is software#Feature and inherits from SoftwareEntity (the old one was more generic without a specific reason)
 - Property software#location (domain=FileRepository) generalised to top#url(domain=top#Entity) in order to be used for both FileRepository and File
 - Class FileContainer renamed to FileCollection (old name was misleading because a FileRepository is a Container of Files but, it is not a FileSystemElement then, it is not a FileContainer!)
 - Class SourceCode renamed to SourceCodeFile (to adopt the same name pattern of the other File subclasses)
 - Class ObjectCode renamed to ObjectCodeFile (to adopt the same name pattern of the other File subclasses)
 - Property "name" now is functional (for coherence with corresponding UML property)
 - All Properties named "owned..." are inverseFunctional (i.e. ownership, differently from containment, cannot be shared)
 - comment of class Method (removed a comment that is part of markos-to-seon.owl).
 - added comments on annotation properties nameCriteria, namespaceCriteria, versionCriteria.
