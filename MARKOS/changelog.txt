MARKOS ontology

V1.6 (nextVersion)
====

Created JavaScript ontology: http://www.markosproject.eu/ontologies/javascript (markos-javascript.owl)

Added prefix mjs:http://www.markosproject.eu/ontologies/javascript#

Added javascript classes
- mjs:Constructor (any JavaScript Function that may be used with the JavaScript operator "new")
- mjs:ActualConstructor (any Constructor actually invoked by some Function using the JavaScript operator "new")
- mjs:Method (any JavaScript Function that is the value of a JavaScript Property.)
- mjs:PrimitiveValue (any JavaScript primitive value) 
- mjs:Function (any JavaScript function)
- mjs:Object (any JavaScript Object)
- mjs:PrimitiveType (any JavaScript primitive type)
- mjs:Property (any JavaScript property)
- mjs:Value (any JavaScript value)
- mjs:Type (Any JavaScript type, i.e. one of 6 built-in types:  Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Number, Object)

Added JavaScript properties
- mjs:invokedConstructor: mjs:Function x mjs:ActualConstructor (Function that is invoked using the operator "new" or the built-in Function "Object.create")
- mjs:invokedFunction: mjs:Function x mjs:Function (JavaScript Function that is called (i.e. invoked without the operator "new" or the built-in Function "Object.create")
- mjs:ownedProperty: mjs:Object x mjs:Property (A JavaScript Property owned by a JavaScript Object.)

Added JavaScript individuals
- UNDEFINED_TYPE, STRING_TYPE, NUMBER_TYPE, BOOLEAN_TYPE, NULL_TYPE (instances of mjs:PrimitiveType)
- UNDEFINED_VALUE, TRUE_VALUE, FALSE_VALUE, NULL_VALUE, POSITIVE_ZERO_VALUE, NAN_VALUE, NEGATIVE_ZERO_VALUE, NEGATIVE_INFINITY_VALUE, POSITIVE_INFINITY_VALUE (instances of mjs:PrimitiveValue)
- OBJECT_TYPE (instance of mjs:Type)


Changed classes:
- Type (is now subclass of SoftwareEntity): the constraint was already in previous versions and removed by error) 
- SoftwareObjectType renamed to ObjectType: because while in the case of SoftwareClass the qualification was useful to distinguish from an OWLCLass, in this case there is not need of disambiguation
- TypedEntity (definition in rdfs:comment has been improved): to better clarify the mapping to UML2
- Attribute (definition in rdfs:comment has been generalised): to capture the case of Object based languages (having no Classifiers)
- Component (no more an ObjectType, but just a Classifier): to cover languages where a Component instance is not an object.
- mweb:WebApplication subclassOf msw:Program (to be coherent with the rdfs:comment)
- Parameter (now represent both BehaviorParameters and TemplateParameters): to represent common properties of Parameters of Behaviors and Templates.
- Constructor (definition in rdfs:comment has been generalised to include also JavaScript constructor functions)
- SoftwareEntity (definition in rdfs:comment has been improved): to clarify that SoftwareEntities are not just entities defined by a programming language specifications, but also from other specification that works on top of a programming language specification. 

Changed properties (name, comment and related constraints):
- subordinateEntity: Entity x NamedEntity -> Entity x Entity (because range of sub-property containedEntity is Entity) 
- ownedParameter: Method x Parameter -> Behavior x Parameter (to be more aligned to UML2)
- valueType renamed to type: because it is used also to both represent the type of (values of) variables and the type of values themselves. 
- ownedParameter renamed to ownedBehaviorParameter (to distinguish it from ownedTemplateParameter and to use the same name pattern; Note that in some language a SoftwareEntity may own both TemplateParaters and BehaviorParameters)

Added msw classes:
- Value (subclassOf TypedEntity): Any SoftwareEntity that can be assigned to a variable
- DataValue (subclassOf Value): Any Value having no identity distinct from its representation
- Object (subclassOf Value): Any value having an identity that is distinct form its representation
- Slot (subclassOf TypedEntity): to represent a set of values of an Attribute
- Template (subclassOf SoftwareEntity): Any SoftwareEntity used to generate other SoftwareEntities, usually types at compile time.
- Parameter (subclass of SoftwareEntity): Any formal parameter.
- ParameterBinding (subclass of top:Entity): Assignment of value to a formal parameter (i.e. specification of an actual parameter).
- ValueType (subclassOf SoftwareEntity): Any Type which instances are Values.
- ParameterizedEntity (subclassOf SoftwareEntity): Any SoftwareEntity having parameters.
- ParameterizedEntityBinding (subclassOf SoftwareEntity): Any SoftwareEntity generated by assigning a value to the parameters of a ParameterizedEntity.
- TemplateBinding (subclassOf ParameterizedEntityBinding): Any SoftwareEntity generated by assigning a value to the parameters of a Template.
- ClassifierValuedParameter (subclassOf Parameter): A Parameter which values can be only Classifiers.
- BehaviorParameter (subclassOf Parameter): A Parameter owned by a Behavior.

Added msw properties:
- extendedSignature: Behavior x String (summarises the main aspects of a Behavior in a single string)
- value: Slot x Value (to represent any value of a Slot)
- ownedSlot: Value x Slot (to represent any Slot owned by a structured Value)
- isOptionalParameter: Parameter x xsd:boolean (to represent optional Parameters)
- isNamedParameter: Parameter x xsd:boolean (to represent Parameters that are identified by name)
- isPositionalParameter: Parameter x xsd:boolean (to represent Parameters that are identified by position)
- defaultValue: Parameter x Value (to specify the default value of optional parameter)
- declarationPosition: Parameter x xsd:positiveInteger (position of the Parameter in the declaration)
- parameterValue: Parameter x SoftwareEntity (value assigned to a Parameter)
- ownedBinding: ParameterizedEntityBinding x ParameterBinding (specification of the actual parameter of a ParameterizedEntityBinding)
- boundEntity: ParameterizedEntityBinding x ParameterizedEntity (the ParametrizedEntity that is bound by the subject ParametrizedEntityBinding)
- associatedAnnotation: SoftwareEntity x Annotation (to associate an Annotation to a SoftwareEntity)

V1.5
====

Created web ontology: http://www.markosproject.eu/ontologies/web (markos-web.owl)

Added prefix mweb:http://www.markosproject.eu/ontologies/web#

Updated version IRIs

Changed individuals:
- mjava:JAVA renamed to msw:JAVA_LANGUAGE (for uniformity with other programming language names)

Added individuals:
- 50 most used programming languages msw:C_LANGUAGE, XML_LANGUAGE, CPP_LANGUAGE, JAVASCRIPT_LANGUAGE...  

Changed classes (name, comment and related constraints):
- Constructor: clarified that, as it inherits from Classifier, it may be both a constructor declaration, i.e. abstract constructor, or a constructor implementation, i.e. concrete constructor)
- SoftwareWork: the definition now clarifies that this is common superclass of both abstract entities (e.g. SoftwareEntity) and concrete entities (e.g. File) 
- SoftwareRelease: now it is just the set of files released by a project. The idea that a SoftwareRelease is a SoftwareEntity was already discarded in the past because a release may contain also files that are not a manifestation of any SoftwareEntity, moreover if two projects would release a single SoftwareEntity we would have 2 releases (with two different release dates), but the SoftwareEntity would be one, so they cannot be the same. The idea that a SoftwareRelease contains both the SoftwareEntities and their manifestation would complicate the definition without clear advantages. The previousVersion of a SoftwareRelease must be a SoftwareRelease 
- ExecutableFile: now is an ObjectCodeFile (to be coherent with the definition of ObjectCodeFile on turn based on the GPL definition of ObjectCode). Moreover now the definition is restricted to OS executable files (the original UML definition was too subjective to be useful for automatic analyses)
- ConfigurationFile: now is a SourceCodeFile (to be coherent with the definition of SourceCodeFile on turn based on the GPL definition of SourceCode)

Added classes (name, comment and related constraints):
- SoftwareForge (subclassOf NamedEntity) : to represent any forge that host software projects
- CodeFile: the disjoint union of SourceCodeFile and ObjectCodeFile	(the most general File type that is coded using a programming language)
- mweb:ServerProgram (to represent any prohram having a server role) 
- mweb:WebServer (to represent any HTTP server)
- mweb:WebBrowser (to represent any web client)
- mweb:ApplicationServer (to represent any HTTP server that is also a framework for specific kind of component based applications)
- mweb:ClientSideWebComponent (to represent a component running in a web browser) 
- mweb:ServerSideComponent (to represent a component running in an extensible ServerProgram)
- mweb:ServerSideWebComponent (to represent a component running in a WebServer)
- mweb:WebApplication (to represent any application based on web components)
- mweb:WebComponent (to represent any component running in a WebServer or webBrowser)

Removed classes:
- Operation: because equivalent to "Method and isAbstract value true"
- ConstructorMethod (Constructor already represents both abstract and concrete constructors).
- BehaviorParameter (as now an Operation is an abstract Behavior, this should be renamed ConcreteBehaviorParameter, because only when the Behavior is concrete it is also a Local variable; anyway there is no clear requirement for this distinction in MARKOS). 
- Variable renamed (again) to TypedEntity (as in the case of a formal parameter of an abstract Method a Parameter is not a Variable, i.e. a storage unit, but just a formal name with some constraint). Clarified that may exist TypedElement without an explicit type. 
- NonCodeFile: because the definition was inconsistent (as according to the other definitions a "non SourceCodeFile" is an "ObjectCodeFile" and a "non (SourceCodeFile o ObjectCodeFile)" is Nothing !
- ApplicationResourse: because not really a type,  but just a role for data or documents.

Changed properties (name, comment and related constraints):
- forkSoftwareWork: SoftwareEntity x SoftwareEntity -> SoftwareWork x SoftwareWork (previous was wrong). Also corrected the label.
- forkedSoftwareWork (corrected the label).
- raisedException: Operation x Type -> Method x Type (because Operation now is an abstract Method)
- ownedParameter: Operation x Type - > Behavior x Parameter (because Operation now is a abstract Method and because any Behavior may have parameters)
- invokedOperation(Behavior x Operation) substituted by invokedMethod:Behavior x Method (because Operation now is a abstract Method and because invokedMethod was missing; moreover the comment now clarify that the behaviour is polymorfic)
- Method now is subclassOf Feature
- ownedAttribute: SoftwareObjectType x Attribute -> Classifier x Attribute 
- msw:webSiteURL renamed to mtop:webSiteURL (for coherence with domain and range)

Added properties:
- licenseTemplate: Work x CopyrightLicenseTemplate = (coveringLicense o template)
- hostingForge: SoftwareProject x SoftwareForge (to represent the forge that hosts a softwareproject) 
- mlic:argumentGraph: LicenseAssessment x xsd:AnyURI 
- codingLanguage: CodeFile x ProgrammingLanguage (the programming language that the code file is written in).
- codingLanguageVersion: CodeFile x ProgrammingLanguageVersion (the programming language version that the code file is written in).

Added annotation properties:
- mlic:creationDate: LicenseAssessment x xsd:DateTime (subpropetyOf dcterms:created)
- mlic:creator: LicenseAssessment x xsd:string (subpropetyOf dcterms:creator)
- mlic:publisher: LicenseAssessment x dcterms:Agent (subpropertyOf dcterms:publisher)

Removed properties:
- ownedOperation (because now Operation is a Method and there is ownedMethod)
- directImplementedOperation (because redundant: corresponds to redefinedEntity when value is an Operation)

Added definition of msw prefix in software ontology

Added definition of mlic prefix in license ontology

Updated mapping to SEON

- Work (old comment was not suitable for the class Work, but only for a property relating a license to the related Work) 
- mtop:url -> msw:url (now restricted to WebDocument x URL to avoid polysemy of old definition Entity x URL).  
- usedSoftwareWork: removed from comment the expression "legally significative way" as not relevant in a sw ontology
- importedPackage:  SoftwareEntity x Package -> Package x Package (old def suitable for sourceCode, not for SoftwareEntity)
- directImplementedinterface: Classifier x Interface -> SoftwareClass x Interface
- manifestation: Work x Artifact -> SoftwareWork x SoftwareArtifact (to avoid questionable extensions out of sw domain)
- provenanceManifestation: Work x Artifact -> SoftwareWork x SoftwareArtifact (same reason than above)
- provenanceSourceCode: Work x SourceCodeFile -> SoftwareEntity x SourceCodeFile (same reason than above)
- provenanceObjectCode: Work x ObjectCodeFile -> SoftwareEntity x ObjectCodeFile (same reason than above)
- msw:usedSoftwareWork (SoftwareWork x SoftwareWork) -> mtop:usedEntity (Entity x Entity) to generalise to entities that are not necessarily Works , such as a programming language (to include previousVersion)
- msw:Java* -> mjava:Java* (mjava: = http://www.markosproject.eu/ontologies/java , to be moved to Java ontology)

Added properties:
- isFinalSpecialization (Classifier x Boolean), corresponding to "is final" for Java classes and interfaces

 - moved labels of licenses concepts to the licenses ontology (they were in the software ontology)
 - changed rdfs:label of OwnedMember to rdfs:comment 
 - provenance: SoftwareWork x SoftwareProject (extended the domain from SoftwareEntity to SoftwareWork to apply it also to a File)
 - rdfs:seeAlso of File to rdfs:comment (it was rdfs:seeAlso for error)
 - Definition of class API (the old one was too restrictive for practical usage)
 - Definition of class Package (the meaning is the same of the old one, but the description is more detailed).
 - Class top#Feature now is software#Feature and inherits from SoftwareEntity (the old one was more generic without a specific reason)
 - Property software#location (domain=FileRepository) generalised to top#url(domain=top#Entity) in order to be used for both FileRepository and File
 - Class FileContainer renamed to FileCollection (old name was misleading because a FileRepository is a Container of Files but, it is not a FileSystemElement then, it is not a FileContainer!)
 - Class SourceCode renamed to SourceCodeFile (to adopt the same name pattern of the other File subclasses)
 - Class ObjectCode renamed to ObjectCodeFile (to adopt the same name pattern of the other File subclasses)
 - Property "name" now is functional (for coherence with corresponding UML property)
 - All Properties named "owned..." are inverseFunctional (i.e. ownership, differently from containment, cannot be shared)
 - comment of class Method (removed a comment that is part of markos-to-seon.owl).
 - added comments on annotation properties nameCriteria, namespaceCriteria, versionCriteria.
